## Certifications et al.

<kbd><img src="./assets/mcp-card.png" alt="Microsoft Certified Professional" width="300" /></kbd>

### Microsoft Certified Professional (MSP)

2005 was an incredible year, one of my favorite gigs! As a contractor I became the primary engineer on the Microsoft Sales, Marketing, Services Group at the Redmond main campus.
I became the owner of the New Hire Advisor SharePoint Team Site, as well as helping the Sharepoint team.  
:muscle: While there, I developed a way to build FrontPage sites dynamically saving hours of dev time. And, since I was already writing core C# code for Sharepoint I decided to get MCP certified.
